### Anderson describes what he calls the "death of theory", what did he mean by this statement? In response, Kitchin offers a rebuttal to Anderson. What do you think? Has big data killed theory? 

I don't believe that Big Data has necessarily killed theory and agree more with Kitchin's perspective. Anderson rightly makes the point that data has increased dramatically in recent years, making it much more difficult to be analyze using previously developed scientific methods.
