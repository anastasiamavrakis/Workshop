### Anderson describes what he calls the "death of theory", what did he mean by this statement? In response, Kitchin offers a rebuttal to Anderson. What do you think? Has big data killed theory? 

I don't believe that Big Data has necessarily killed theory and agree more with Kitchin's perspective. Anderson rightly makes the point that data has increased dramatically in recent years, making it much more difficult to be analyze using previously developed scientific methods. He proposes the hypothesis that using statistical analysis of data and entirely ommitting human interference is enough to promote the huge growth of companies, citing Google and search engines as a whole as an example. Alongside this ideal, he claims that utilizing correlation is now a sufficient replacement for previous scientific theories. Kitchin, on the other hand, combines the idea that while yes, Big Data is expanding rapidly, it is essentially the key to improving scientific algorithms as opposed to destroying them, as it is so widely spread and easily accesible while still maintaining its accuracy. I agree with Kitchin overall as I believe Big Data has the oppurtunity to enhance the birth of theory in a way that has yet to be seen, as evidenced by the thousands of practical applications Big Data provides that have already been seen through the articles read in this class, such as the utilization of call detail records (CDRs) to distribute humanitarian aid.
