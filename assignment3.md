# Geospatial Data Methods in Investigating Food Insecurity and Poverty in Rwanda


## Introduction

An ever-growing problem in East Africa has been increasing poverty rates which have subsequently led to a spike in child mortality, and this problem is seen at its highest peak in Rwanda, the most densely populated nation in the entire continent. The inherent harms of these facts are seen daily- households are unable to acquire basic nutritional needs and the most children fall victim to malnutrition. In a study analyzed previously, it was even determined that a majority of children between the ages of 1-2 do not even meet the minimal dietary diversity that is necessary for a growing infant. [3] As Rwanda has a largely agricultural-based society and economy, already scarce resources become even more unpredictable as a result of an ever evolving climate and stark changes in precipitation annually. In Rwanda in particular, it is crucial to identify the inherent interconnectedness of poverty and food insecurity in order to properly tackle this aspect of human development. 

## Inquiry Type

The research question I have proposed is “How can household indicators of poverty be analyzed to increase the effectiveness of poverty and hunger relief efforts in Rwanda?”. I believe that this question falls into the descriptive inquiry category as my data science methods seek to establish a profile of sorts of households in Rwanda and how specific demographic information and certain socioeconomic factors are patterns among families, and thus how they subsequently contribute to the rising poverty rate in the nation as a whole. In order to understand how this area of human development affects people in Rwanda, starting with households rather than attempting to look at the entire economy may reveal far more about the standard of living than even official census data can provide. 

## Method 1

The first method I am going to analyze was proposed by Felicia Akinyemi and introduces the use of spatial data through maps in order to visually communicate patterns in household living standards (HLS) in the city of Kigali, the capital of Rwanda. The data used maps of district and sector boundaries in combination with a database comprised of Integrated Living Condition Survey results that centered on three particular dimensions (health, access to services, and education) of HLS which were even further divided into multiple indicators of poverty, a few examples being the percentage of people with access to education, healthcare, or safe drinking water. To analyze the data Akinyemi used the ArcGIS 9.3 software package in order to transform all spatial data for the mapped out districts and zones into vector format. From there, the data from these zones were represented in GIS as centroid points, and the Inverse Distance Weighting method of interpolation was implemented, spatial interpolation being a way to estimate data at non-surveyed locations based on known measurements from other areas. This technique helped visualize the distribution of the poverty indicators over the entire area being studied since it essentially creates a continuous raster surface of every indicator. For the maps themselves, a diverging color classification scheme was used to emphasize median critical values as well as extremes. [1]

The results focused on many household indicators, but perhaps the most important one was enrollment in primary and secondary level education which was found through the net enrollment ratio (NER) which was calculated by dividing the number of students enrolled who are within the official age bracket for a given level of education by the population for the same age-group, multiplied by 100. These calculations are shown in the figure below which reveal that the highest enrollment rates were found near the southern parts of the city, whereas the northern and central parts of Kigali had much lower rates which could be due to a lack of resources in schools and an inability to afford expenses related to education.

Overall, this method proved to show an accurate and succinct portrayal of multiple household indicators of poverty including enrollment in education so that these factors may be compared in order to determine which correlate most directly to poverty and thus which factors should be viewed when determining where to distribute aid. 
 

## Method 2

Another methodology that I explored was proposed by Neal Jean and implements the idea of transfer learning which utilizes a proxy for poverty in order to teach a deep learning model. From there the model estimates average household wealth and expenses at the lowest level (the cluster level) of geographic aggregation for which data can be determined through public surveys. In order to quantify wealth, an asset index is used to group survey responses based on assets. In order to do this, the model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that has been trained on ImageNet, a data set of thousands of labeled images. In order to learn to classify every picture appropriately, the model utilizes small features such as corners/edges that are found in many vision tasks. After this, the CNN is used to predict what the intensity of nighttime lights will be based on given input daytime satellite images. This allows the trained CNN to condense the input images into lower-dimensional sets of image features that predict variation. Thus, the CNN can be utilized to extract features and learn nonlinear mapping from each input into a specific vector representation. Finally, the survey data and the image features found by the CNN are used in order to train regression models that can then predict assets at the cluster level. The results were that the model was very accurate in predicting average household consumption as well as wealth across multiple African countries and found 37-75% of variation in average household consumption across 4 nations for which survey data was available and 55-75% variation in average household wealth across 5 nations. 



## Conclusion

In conclusion, both models show a highly accurate way that household data such as wealth, consumption, and living standards can contribute to better understanding causes of poverty in Rwanda and other Eastern African countries. Though both models were extensive and included a great deal of spatial data, I still believe that there is a gap in the literature in terms of data sharing. Census data in Rwanda is old and out-dated and surveys aren’t conducted as often as they should be, making the implementation of some transfer learning models like the one mentioned above more difficult. Overall, I believe the solution to this problem would be to implement some sort of legal policy in order to promote spatial data collection and sharing among the government and poverty relief efforts.
