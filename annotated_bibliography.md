According to the World Health Organization, one of the most important and accurate predictors child malnutrition lies in one's dietary diversity score, which is defined as the number of food groups consumed over a period of time. This number can be used as a sufficient predictor for nutritional adequacy, and therefore it is a good indicator of a child’s growth and overall weight. In nations that are impoverished and have less resources, such as Rwanda, it is common to see that a majority of children do not have a sufficient dietary diversity score and in most cases, do not even meet the minimum dietary diversity of eating 4 different food groups. In this article, the authors conducted a study at a hospital in an impoverished part of the world, where they analyzed what children between the ages of 6-23 months were consuming based on a 24 hour recall method, where the children were interviewed to determine what they had eaten the previous day. The data was analyzed using statistical software over the course of three days. The results were grouped by age, and revealed that the median dietary diversity score for children between the ages of 6-12 months was a 2 out of the possible 7 and for children between 13-23 months old, this score rose to 4, the minimum dietary diversity score. The conclusion was then made that there is in fact a positive correlation between age and dietary diversity score. This is pertinent due to the fact that the biggest predictor of a child’s diversity score is annual household funds. Thus, it is likely that developing nations will have decreased child nutritional status. This article relates to Sen’s definition of development in that it emphasizes the fact that mean income is not the only predictor of growth, and freedom, in this case freedom to have multiple nutritional options, is key. The authors are addressing the poverty and food insecurity aspects of human development, with the most pertinent SDG being #2, that is, to end hunger and improve nutrition. The data that is pertinent to the study is the demographic profile of those involved as well as the anthropometric measurements of the subjects, and the methods used were the Mann Whitney U test and the Kruskal Wallis test, which are both tests of significance to identify the mean difference between groups of qualitative data. Overall, the question that the authors were trying to answer was whether or not the age of children living in poverty affects their dietary diversity score when all other confounding variables are removed.
